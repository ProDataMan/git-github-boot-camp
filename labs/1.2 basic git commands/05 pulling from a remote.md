# Pulling from a Remote

Currently, we are in sync with our remote. Let's change something in the remote, but not in our local repository. This simulates a change by someone else.
Go to your repository on github.com and click on a file under the "Code" tab:

![GitHub repository](../../img/github-repo.png)
 
Click on the pencil icon to edit this file online:

![GitHub file](../../img/github-file.png)
 
Edit the file by adding some text:

![GitHub file editing](../../img/github-file-2.png)
 
Add a commit message and commit the change:

![GitHub file editing](../../img/github-file-3.png)
 
On your local machine, you can now pull these changes:

![Git pull](../../img/git-pull.png)

Our local file now contains the changes we made on the remote:
