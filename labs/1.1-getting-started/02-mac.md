# Installing Git on Mac OS X

## Installer
Use [the installer](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) you can find on the official Git website.

## Homebrew

If you prefer Homebrew, you can run:

```
brew install git
```

## Verify

Open a terminal and run this command:

```
git --version
```

It should print out the version of Git. If it does, Git was installed correctly.
