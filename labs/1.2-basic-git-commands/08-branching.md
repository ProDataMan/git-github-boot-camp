# Creating a Branch

Create and check out a new branch:

![Git branch](../../img/git-branch.png)
 
Add some commits by changing, adding and committing files, like we did previously. You should end up with a log like this:

![Git log](../../img/git-log-2.png)
 
Notice how:
- Our remote (origin/master) is currently at an older commit
- The HEAD of our repository (where we are in our repository) is pointing to our new branch
